# docker
Docker was created to satisfy the need of redevelop it for all existing platforms and OSs for unification and normalisation:
it makes it possible to split an application into several microservices, light, adaptable, universal and scalable, and it also gives the system administrators a great flexibility to deploy and scale
up the app.
This suite of projects on Docker will help to better understand this specific tool, but
also the various aspects of applications development using microservices.
