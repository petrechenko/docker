# Increase the number of copies of the marines service up to twenty, because there’s never enough Marines to eliminate Zergs. (Remember to take a# look at the tasks and logs of the service, you’ll see, it’s fun.)

docker service scale -d marines=20

# scale — Scale one or multiple replicated services
# --detach , -d — Exit immediately instead of waiting for the service to converge
# to check docker service logs -f $(docker service ps marines -f "name=marines.11" -q)
