# Launch a shell from an alpine container, and make sure that you can interact directly with the container via your terminal, and that the contai# ner deletes itself once the shell’s execution is done

docker run -it --rm alpine sh

#-i, --interactive — Keep STDIN open even if not attached.
#-t, --tty — Allocate a pseudo-TTY.
#--rm — Automatically remove the container when it exits
#Usually, an Alpine Linux image doesn't contain bash, Instead you can use /bin/ash, /bin/sh, ash or only sh
#exit to quit
