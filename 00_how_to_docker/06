# Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task. It should be named ove# rlord, be able to restart on its own, and have # its 80 port attached to the 5000 port of Char. # You can check that your container functions properly by visiting
# http://<ip-de-char>:5000 on your web browser

docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name overlord --restart=always nginx

#-d, --detach — Run container in background and print container ID.
#--name string — Assign a name to the container.
#-p, --publish list — Publish a container's port(s) to the host.
#--restart to specify a container’s restart policy. A restart policy controls whether the Docker daemon restarts a container after exit
