# Get the hello-world container from the Docker Hub, where it’s available

docker pull hello-world

# Docker Hub is the place where open Docker images are stored. When we ran our first image by typing
#docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 rocker/verse

# the software first checked if this image is available on your computer and since it wasn’t it downloaded the image from Docker Hub. So getting an image from Docker Hub works sort of automatically. If you just want to pull the image but not run it, you can also do
#docker pull rocker/verse

#check the result
#docker image ls
